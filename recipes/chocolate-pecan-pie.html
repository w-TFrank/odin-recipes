        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Not just any chocolate pie…. this Chocolate Pecan Pie is a cross between a pecan pie, chocolate fudge, molten brownies and a hot fudge chocolate pudding. Spiked with optional bourbon, our recipe is addictive and irresistible.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups pecans</li>
            <li>6 ounces 70% chocolate roughly chopped into pieces (or semisweet chocolate)</li>
            <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter melted</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder (I use Hershey's)</li>
            <li>3/4 cup golden syrup maple syrup, rice syrup or light corn syrup</li>
            <li>3/4 cup light brown sugar packed</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons all purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons bourbon optional</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract</li>
            <li>3/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>4 large eggs whisked</li>
            <li>9 inch pie crust or pie shell</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven 350°F (175°C) with rack on lowest position in oven. Prepare pie crust. If using uncooked pie crust, prick the base a few times with a fork to prevent air bubbles before pouring in the filling.</li>
            <li>When oven is hot, toast pecans on a baking sheet for 10 minutes. Roughly chop half of the toasted pecans. Reserve the other half for decorating the top of the pie.</li>
            <li>Fill a small pot 1/3 of the way with water and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. </li>
            <li>Reduce heat to low and place a heat-proof bowl on the pot. Fill the bowl with the chocolate and stir continuously until the chocolate is melted. </li>
            <li>Add the butter to the chocolate, stirring well to combine until butter is melted. Mix in the cocoa powder until completely dissolved.</li>
            <li>Take the bowl off the heat. Whisk in syrup, sugar, flour, bourbon, vanilla and salt.</li>
            <li>Add the eggs and whisk well to combine. Fold in chopped pecans. Pour into prepared pie shell and top with remaining pecans.</li>
            <li>Bake for 50-55 minutes or until centre is just set to the touch but still a little jiggly underneath. If your pie is browning too fast, loosely tent with foil. </li>
            <li>The pie will be puffed up as soon as it comes out of the oven, but it will deflate and flatten as it cools. Let cool on a wire rack for about 4 hours and serve warm, or refrigerate to chill overnight.</li>
        </ol>
